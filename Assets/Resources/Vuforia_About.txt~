At the moment ViewR is just a demo application that basically mixes a side by side view 
for head mounted displays like the Durovis Dive with the Augmented Reality SDK Vuforia.
Despite it's limited functionality, ViewR gives an impression, of what it could be like
to use a smart wearable like google glass and much more.

Key Functionality
- Apply different shaders for various image effects (for instance inverted colors, fish eye, etc.)
- Shows information in the right upper corner of the display (target information and data from gyro)
- Recognizes predefined targets that will expose 3D models and also play videos 
- Manage camera functions: flash and continuous autofocus
